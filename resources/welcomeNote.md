## Welcome to NoteMark 👋🏻

NoteMark is a simple **note-taking app** that uses **Markdown** syntax to format your notes.

You can create your first note by clicking on the top-left icon on the sidebar, or delete one by clicking on the trash can button.

Here's a quick overview of the currently supported Markdown syntax.

## Text Formatting

To **bold** text, surround it with "\*\*".
To _italicize_ text, surround it with "\_" (or single "\*"s).

## Headings

Here are all the heading formats currently supported by **_NoteMark_**:

# Heading 1

(You can make a line of text an H1 by adding "\# " at the start of the line)

## Heading 2

(Same here, but with two "\#" (e.g. "\#\# "))

### Heading 3

(Same thing again, but with three "\#" this time, followed by a space " ")

#### Heading 4

(And I think you get the idea 😉)

### Bulleted list

You can add items to a bulleted list by starting the line with "\- ".

Example (feel free to play around with this):

- item 1
- item 2
- item 3

### Numbered list

You can make a numbered list similarly to how you'd make a bulleted one, but instead of using "\-" followed by a space at the start of the line, use a number followed by a space (e.g. "1. ")

Example (Play around! This is your note, after all):

1. Item One
2. Item Two
3. Item Three

And so on...
